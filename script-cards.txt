-	Bring your expanding field of sensitivity to the areas in your body that are depleted, starved and less sensitive.

sunset on the ocean	a skeleton
endless desert	dawn of day
a star in the sky	coffin beside a grave
morning dew	laughing Buddha
lions and lambs resting together	a cocoon
soaring flock of birds	butterflies
 

bonfire at night	waves crashing on shore
a crocodile	a deer
symbol for Om	a cave
inverted red triangle	6-pointed star


And now be still.......still in that black space behind the forehead and observe what passes.......witnessing unattached to all that passes......if nothing appears, just be aware of that.....
Be totally present.....completely absorbed.....(pause 5-7 breaths).

4.	Chakra Visualization

Chakra Visualization:
-	Muladhara Chakra: Place all your attention at the Muladhara Chakra, located at the base of the spine. Feel this area begin to glow and pulse. Feel the earthly, dense quality of this chakra. Now let this grounding be a foundation for awakening into higher centers of consciousness. See the downward and outward flow of energy being reversed
and converted to upward flow. Drawing up energy from the feet, legs into the perineum and up through the central energy canal -- the shushumna. Feel the first chakra open and relax.

-	Swadistana  Chakra: Located in the pelvis, the area of the reproductive organs and the sacral nerve plexus. Feel this area beginning to pulse and glow -- allowing this energy to nourish reproductive functions and sensuality -- but also Divine Shakti is freed, visualize your body filled with divine light and love.

-	Manipura Chakra: Now bring your total awareness to the manipura chakra located at the navel -- associated with the solar plexus of nerves that nurtures all the abdominal organs of the area. Feel this area beginning to pulse and glow. Allow the primal forces of aggression and compulsion to dissolve in the light of your awareness -- and sense it being converted to clarity, confidence and strength. Facing all challenges with equanimity and dignity.

-	Feel you are now free of all limitations. Your inner core feels vital and strong and connected to source. You lack absolutely nothing as you step into the next integrated state of being.
 

Now bring your attention to:
-	Anahata Chakra, the heart center -- connected with the cardiac plexus.  Feel the area in the middle of the chest beginning to pulse and glow with green light.  Experience the regenerative, restorative healing power activating health functioning of heart, lungs and thymus gland.  See the heart center transmuting the energies of the lower chakras. Experience a deep sense of love and compassion.  Let it change your perception of the world.  Feel yourself becoming a beacon of love and light -- attracting the energies of the lower centers and transforming them at the heart.

-	Visuddha Chakra: Bring your attention to the throat, the cervical nerve plexus. Feel the throat and thyroid gland glowing and pulsing with blue light.  See yourself entering into the expansiveness of the throat chakra, from where you can reclaim your voice of wisdom. You are free from all inhibitions and limitations to awaken creative expression.

-	Ajna Chakra: Bring your attention now to the Ajna Chakra -- the Third Eye.  Feeling the area between the eyebrows and about three inches in towards the center of the brain begin to glow and pulse with indigo light.  Feel the pituitary and pineal glands being reactivated and rejuvenated deep inside the brain.  Receive the time transcendant nectar of Amrit, dripping from the pineal gland penetrating and spreading through every cell of your being.  Rest in awareness.

-	If there is any chakra or corresponding area of your body that needs additional healing, bring your attention to that area now, see it bathed in healing light.

-	Sahasrara Chakra: Now see a thousand petal lotus at the crown of the head. Feel all the chakras spontaneously and effortlessly aligned.  See energy moving unimpeded upward towards the crown chakra.  See the whole body surrounded and permeated by light.  All boundaries and illusion of separateness disappearing.  Dissolve and disappear into oneness.
